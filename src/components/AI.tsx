                <h1 id="origin">The Origins and Future of A.I.</h1>
                <h2 id="origin-intro">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the beginning of a new generation, a new world, and
                    new technology to finish homework; this is A.I within the
                    computer. The Origins of A.I contain how programs for A.I
                    are made or created and where A.I is placed. This may be
                    just the start of the beginning but there are predictions
                    for the future of Artificial Intelligence. The future of
                    artificial intelligence can be predicted and have results of
                    privacy issues, corruption, and finally new job
                    opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2 id="origin-origin">Origins of A.I.</h2>
                <p>
                    The origins of A.I come from where someone creates a script
                    or program focusing on one main function for the A.I to use
                    or interpret for users. How programmers write computer
                    programs for A.I is that they first find a main function for
                    it or problem for it to solve, second they prepare the data
                    to input inside the A.I code or assistant, third they choose
                    the algorithms needed for the program, fourth they train the
                    program. Computer programmers train A.I. by giving them huge
                    amounts full of layers of data asking the A.I to take in the
                    data, the A.I then studies the inputted data and finally
                    makes a suggestion or solution for problems or it&apos;s
                    function that was given. The second-last step is to choose a
                    programming language fit for your A.I. Some well-known
                    languages used for A.I are Python mostly used for Machine
                    Learning, Java is versatile and because of its Virtual
                    Machine Tech it allows developments of Artificial languages
                    on different platforms; another common language used for A.I
                    platforms or assistants is Lisp even though it is pretty old
                    in still includes critical features for success in A.I
                    Projects. The final step that Artificial Intelligence
                    programmers do is that they run it on a secure proper
                    platform. Not just building A.I is important the place that
                    the A.I is placed or where Artificial intelligence is.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The place that the specific A.I is placed in is vital
                    because it is connected to the main &apos;cause&apos; or
                    function. A.I is placed in many places throughout the
                    computer. Different functions are used for different places
                    is something to keep in mind. Because of the many varieties
                    of A.I it is wide across the web and throughout apps. The
                    most common place to find AI is at an Online Search Engine
                    which is a platform with suggestions on what to search and
                    tons of solutions based on your search or provides many
                    solutions or answers to your question. You can find these in
                    daily life like Google and Safari. A.I is found throughout
                    apps and websites.
                </p>
                <h2 id="origin-future">Future of A.I.</h2>
                <p>
                    AI systems are impacting how we live now and in the future.
                    A.I can corrupt in ways unthinkably bad and can affect us.
                    Sometimes after a while A.I engines can slowly create a mind
                    of their own and start to corrupt. An example is that once
                    Facebook created two A.I assistant chatbots on computers,
                    soon enough they came to life and created a language of
                    their own and spoke to each other secretly in another
                    language (info given by Kaan Mutluoglu). This is a major
                    sign of corruption.Corruption can be found in many ways and
                    can actually lead to Privacy issues. Privacy Issues can be
                    found in A.I because AI assistants, chatbots, and systems
                    can actually look within your account and use data from that
                    to “help you”. Actually AI systems and development impacting
                    the future doesn&apos;t have to be so dark and scary, AI in
                    computer systems can open up new job opportunities. For
                    example AI system developers, controlling AI and making sure
                    of no corruption, and so much more! AI can be the future for
                    good and bad just found in your computer.

                <p>
                    Origins of A.I and the future of A.I can be bad and can be
                    good. Lets review; the Origins of A.I come from computer
                    programmers and the fact that the place of where the
                    Artificial Intelligence is placed is as vital as the origins
                    and code of A.I. Anything that starts good, has a 50% chance
                    of a good ending, and a 50% chance of a bad ending. Now that
                    that&apos;s done let&apos;s move on to how A.I works and
                    trains.
                </p>
                <h1 id="train">How A.I Works and Trains</h1>
                <h2 id="train-intro">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Deep down how A.I works is through subsets of it basically
                    groups and they use those groups and then input that
                    group&apos;s main knowledge and apply it to the A.I. Since
                    there are many subsets for A.I let’s break it down to three
                    main ones. First up I’ll be talking about Machine Learning,
                    Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. Now for A.I training
                    you’ll be learning about learning and applying, and how it
                    learn
                </p>
                <h2 id="train-subset">The Subsets</h2>
                <FactBox
                    name="Did you know?"
                    content="There are over 20 subsets of AI, but they're all related in a way"
                />
                <p>
                    Machine Learning is a main group you may have heard of
                    before, well you may not have known that it is actually part
                    of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning works using
                    something called neural networks (human neutrons except in a
                    computer that are algorithms) to search for hidden insights
                    from past data and solutions that have worked before without
                    having any scripts on what to search for and what to
                    conclude. Since it is Artificial intelligence it develops
                    more knowledge through A.I training enabling it to find
                    patterns within its work and of course expand its knowledge.
                    Since machine Learning is so popular and wide it actually
                    has an element which is a subset. Which is pretty much a
                    different subset of artificial intelligence that is also a
                    subset of Machine Learning. Deep Learning uses neural
                    networks with tons of layers, taking advantage of its size
                    to load huge amounts of information with complicated
                    patterns. The only difference that sets Deep Learning apart
                    from Machine Learning is that it has more data and more
                    layers.

                <p>
                    Computer Vision utilizes something called pattern
                    recognition. Pattern Recognition is when computers are
                    scripted/ programmed to understand and read patterns then
                    repeat, study, or use them. Pretty simple. Along with
                    Pattern Recognition Computer vision utilizes Deep Learning.
                    Computer vision uses these to understand a picture, video
                    and any sort of photo. Meaning that the machine or device
                    can look around and take photographs or video in present
                    time as well as interpreting the surroundings.

                    Since you now have at least some knowledge about A.I you may
                    be wondering about how it learns. How Artificial
                    intelligence learns is that throughout time it “changed its
                    ways” and was relying on programmed rules and logical
                    knowledge to instincts to Machine Learning, where you can
                    find that algorithms contain barely any rules and take in
                    training data, experiences and learns by trial and error.
                    A.I actually applies its knowledge to the app by first
                    optimizing the searching process of the application, then
                    integrating the audio or video recognition for Computer
                    Vision apps like Camera on IPhone, then you can create a
                    chat bot like an intelligent and friendly digital assistant.
                    Another way that people can actually integrate A.I into
                    their websites is they can first get a web developer to
                    build a personalized chat bot and you can program it to
                    learn, or use a chatbot tool and then you can add it to any
                    platform or website.

                    Knowing the Subsets of A.I can take you above and beyond
                    allowing you to perhaps have a future in computer knowledge
                    areas. To wrap it up just remember that Subsets of A.I can
                    vary but in the end they are all used for A.I, they can
                    learn and apply their knowledge to websites or apps too.
                    Next up you’ll be learning about How A.I is used.

                    even in plain sight! First off we have how A.I is used.
                    There are tons of different A.I uses so let&apos;s shrink it
                    down to three. A.I is used in voice recognition, Chatbots,
                    and Online Shopping
                </p>
                <h2 id="used-computers">A.I use in computers</h2>
                <p>
                    A.I is used for voice recognition. Most people around the
                    world know to call out Siri, Alexa, or basically any AI
                    assistants for directions or when in need of help. Pretty
                    much an A.I butler. This type of technology is actually just
                    a form of A.I systems and intelligence. Voice recognition is
                    helped by a famous subset of A.I known as Machine Learning.
                    Machine Learning helps voice recognition devices or systems
                    learn about one and their preferences enabling it to know
                    how to help one. Machine Learning then helps voice
                    recognition devices or systems input data within them to
                    help understand your question, provide solutions or
                    suggestions to topics related or is your question. Voice
                    recognition can also get tasks done because of past data and
                    observations from previous experiences. Such tasks could be
                    for example asking to play a song, setting a timer, or
                    giving weather information. Just like use in voice
                    recognition A.I’s use in computers is vast and so onto A.I
                    within ChatBots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voice recognition can actually be found in ChatBots but
                    rarely that occurs. A.I is used for ChatBots. Many companies
                    or large businesses use A.I to actually strengthen and make
                    their companies powerful in customer service teams and
                    groups. A chatbot is basically some sort of computer program
                    that answers questions and can possibly have conversations
                    with humans in real-time usually occurring over the internet
                    (conversations from chatbots to humans are mostly online).
                    ChatBots are actually pretty similar to Voice Recognition
                    devices or systems because they both look at previous
                    responses or questions asked and provide suggestions based
                    on that. Kind of like Pattern Recognition. Some certain
                    words can be used as a “trigger word” meaning some word will
                    output a certain reaction, definition, and verbiage. This
                    kind of elite system can give around a “human-level”
                    explanation, interaction. ChatBots can be very human-like.
                    ChatBots are more of a Human transferred into a computer.
                    A.I’s power and variety of uses can be shown well in
                    ChatBots and Online Shopping Features.

                />

                <h2 id="used-shopping">Shopping Features</h2>
                <p>
                    Now onto Online Shopping. A.I is used in Online shopping.
                    This may be shocking but it can be used in this category and
                    is used in modern-day. Online shopping, voice recognition,
                    ChatBots are all pretty similar because they all learn about
                    preferences of one and all about them; But what separates
                    Online SHopping from the other two is that Online Shopping
                    uses Algorithms to learn about someone and Online Shopping
                    also predict is what you would like to buy or look at.
                    Online shopping looks at previous data and can maybe use
                    computer vision and interpret someone’s place and decide
                    what they&apos;re missing or what they might want. It can
                    predict what you want based on previous searches and might
                    even find the perfect item for you! Because of the feature
                    of predicting what you might want Retailers can constantly
                    display items you may want, for example Amazon trying to
                    grab your attention to buy buy buy! Some Retailers keep on
                    thinking “It’s all ‘bout that dough”. Sometimes retailers
                    don’t fully accomplish their goals in that area and so they
                    constantly work on their algorithms, programs, scripts over
                    and over again just to learn about customers and what they
                    might buy.

                <p>
                    Companies these days are using high tech in some cases
                    artificial intelligence systems. Now remember that
                    everywhere you look A.I is there.Shopping, chatbots, voice
                    recognition. A.I use is there for everything you only just
                    started the journey of A.I. So welcome to the new age.

                <h1 id="life">Chapter 4: Finding A.I in Daily Life</h1>
                <h2 id="life-intro">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered about the thought that something
                    could be tracking you or that there could be A.I in your
                    device watching and watching and watching… Well I’m not sure
                    if there is something tracking you but I can tell you there
                    is A.I everywhere in computers, phones, IPads and pretty
                    much in any device. Some famous companies, apps, and
                    websites use A.I systems as I said before. Here are some
                    apps that use A.I systems, code, and programs. AI can be
                    found in Google apps and Educational tools. Since we talked
                    about How A.I is used just remember how they were used and
                    their purposes for this chapter.
                </p>
                <h2 id="life-google">Google Apps</h2>
                <Fig
                    src={ai6}
                    caption="Source: https://www.theverge.com/22286339/google-drive-storage-more-space-how-to-photos-files"
                />
                <p>
                    A.I can be found in Various Google Apps. Mainly I’ll be
                    focusing on Google Docs, an app used for writing down
                    information, essays, or basically any data. Google Docs
                    contains tons of A.I systems. Google Docs uses to subsets of
                    A.I known as Computer Vision, NLP(Natural Language
                    Processing), and OCR(Optical character recognition) Google
                    Docs has a grammar checker and word checker, meaning that it
                    checks if what you write down is illogical or not and if you
                    spelled the word right or wrong. Using OCR helps Google Docs
                    because as I said before, Google Docs uses grammar and
                    spelling checks which are only sustained and still “alive”
                    because of OCR. When you read the word Optical Character
                    Recognition you can get some sort of idea of what it is.
                    Since it is character recognition it will recognize a
                    certain character (letter, number, symbol) and check if it
                    fits within that sentence or word.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way to see that A.I is in Google Apps is well the
                    app Google. Google(the app) has A.I in it. If you haven’t
                    figured it out yet Google is an Online Search Engine
                    (Chapter 3). A quick recap on Online Search Engines: A
                    platform which has suggestions on what to search along with
                    answers and solutions on searches you put in and solutions
                    to topics related to your search. It uses previous data to
                    guess what you are searching for. Since Google is a
                    searching platform it has pretty much the features of an
                    Online Search Engine. Google lets you search online and
                    provides suggestions on what to search, solutions on
                    searches, solutions on related topics as well. Google is an
                    absolute definition of an Online Search Engine.

                <h2 id="life-edu">Educational Tools</h2>
                <p>
                    A.I can be found in a variety of Educational Tools. For
                    example Plagiarism Checkers and Citation Finders; A.I use in
                    Educational Tools is very helpful to students because of the
                    fact that they can utilize this to enhance their essays and
                    papers results as well as research. It works like this; AI
                    systems first take in the article made by a student then
                    checks for any plagiarized content using Originality Reports
                    and sees if anything is copy pasted, then reports what
                    errors to fix and what the results are. The A.I systems can
                    read and understand the words used to check for spelling,
                    grammar errors, plagiarized content, and so much more! This
                    can also be like Content Scanning Software.

                <h2 id="life-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    There is so much stuff to learn about A.I there are so many
                    types of technological ideas to learn about. I quote myself
                    we barely touched the surface of A.I there are so many more
                    types of subsets, uses, and other places to find Artificial
                    Intelligence systems in daily life, I even have different
                    theories on the outcome of the the future of A.I.{" "}
